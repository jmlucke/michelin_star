# Michelin Star

A project that uses the following data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackywang529/michelin-restaurants

Use the following to start the project:

```
python3 -m http.serve
```

This will start a server at localhost:8000. Go to that web address in chrome to see the site.

You can import data from `michelin__clearned.csv` into a DB of your choice. I used MySQL.

### Future

1) Everything is very early right now, so development in general
2) Add an actual server (maybe node)
3) Add an API so other applications can use the data
4) (Maybe) Scrape websites in the data for images and descriptions of websites
